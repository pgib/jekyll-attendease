# Jekyll::Attendease

A Jekyll plugin, brings in data from your Attendease event and allows you to use it in your Jekyll templates for awesome event websites.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'jekyll-attendease'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install jekyll-attendease


Next, make sure to require it. Add the following file `_plugins/attendease.rb` and content:

``` ruby
require "jekyll-attendease"
```

## Configuration

You will need to configure by editing your `_config.yml`:

``` yaml
#
# Plugin: jekyll-attendease
#
attendease:
  api_host: https://your-event-subdomain.attendease.com/
  test_mode: true # this generates pages for /regsister, /schedule, and /presenters for local development and styling.
```

Remember to replace `https://your-event-subdomain.attendease.com/` with your actual event url, or crazy things will happen!

Setting `test_mode` will create pages for /register, /schedule and
/presenters. You may style these pages, but they are non-functional.
When the site is deployed to Attendease these will function.

## Usage

Now the event name can easily be used in your site like so:

`{{ site.attendease.data.attendease_event_name }}`

We can also use logical expressions like so:

```
{% if site.attendease.data.attendease_has_registration %}
  We have registration!
{% endif %}
```
